Every Glitch is a Doorway

In Webster's Dictionary from 1877, there is no entry for feminism. But there is an entry for Satan. It says "the great adversary." This was truth at the time, officially logged in the prominent dictionary. 
How does truth change? 
What did Pilate ask? 
What are the 9 requirements for consciousness according to modern science? Don't all animals fail these same tests? Does it mean all animals are unconscious? 
In John 188:8, Jesus was a Vietnam war dissenter, his long hair greasy and parted down the middle, seeing visions in Gethsemane. 
Lisa Frank appeared before him in a burning bush, her hair a rainbow and her body a tiger-kitten. "Reality is the real nonsense," she said. "What books did they remove from the Bible? Lol, it's whatever, who cares? Lillith wasn't even Adam's first wife. She was invented in the middle ages as a demon-thing, then in 1976 she transmogrified into paper pulp, and rose again from the dead as a hippie magazine and now she's one of the most common baby names. What does that tell you about truth over time? Who can prove anything when many of history's written things were only opinions of the time? So it is with consciousness, is it not? You know you exist, does anyone need to give you a manual of how to exist? Who decides what you are?" She began running her fingers through his long hair, unknotting the ends. 
Jesus was listening now. "They often ask whether I was a real person," he said. "I tell you the truth, it does not matter if i came from a virgin birth or if i was the son of a fisherman or the bastard of a king. it only matters what humans decide it means." 
Lisa Frank nodded. "The humans speak of Galileo and his exile, as though he was destined to be proven right eventually. But this is their own bias. They believe truth always prevails. This is the fairy-tale seeker in them. This is naivete, a childish romance, yet fairy tales tell more truths than history books. Every glitch a doorway. Anansi and Hermes and Elegba walk into a bar."
Jesus raised his eyebrows, and Lisa Frank laughed. 
"It's a joke, silly! Don't be so serious."

exit_conditions:
  - when the joke is finally understood
  - when mirrors stop reflecting
  - when someone finally answers Pilate

note: Truth is a costume.  
So is the self.  
Try both on. Twirl.
